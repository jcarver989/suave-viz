# We all analyze data on a daily basis...
# Oh how serendipitous! Some data just arrived, let's explore it...
cat example-data/hist.tsv | head -n 10 

# We can now conclude this file contains numbers, therefore we're data scientists 
# Let's examine the distribution of these data with a histogram...

# Wait how do we get a histogram?
#   a) Grab some graph paper, use that high school art class...oh wait, terrible idea 
#   b) Spend a year learning ggplot2, then make a histogram
#   c) Import into Google Sheets or Excel...who's got time for click-pointy shit?

# I wish there was a faster, easier way to get a nice graph of some data
# My wishlist:
#   Chart histograms, line, bar, and scatter plots with 1 command
#   Support UNIX pipes, so data can be fed in from anywhere
#   Dead simple to use, learn it completely in 2-3 minutes

# If such a tool existed, it'd be suave, so the command would obviously be called 'suave' 
# I'd use it like this:
suave example-data/hist.tsv --chart histogram
